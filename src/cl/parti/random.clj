The render functions generate a graphical mosaic from a sequence of random
values.  The source of these values must meet several conditions:

- it can be seeded by a large number of bits;
- it is sensitive to even small changes in the seed;
- it is robust to a lack of bits in the initial seed (eg if all zeroes).

I searched for a standard solution to this problem and found that a block
cipher in counter mode should be appropriate.  However, standard Java only
supports block ciphers up to 128 bit keys.  To extend the key space multiple
ciphers are run in parallel; their results are combined using xor.

*IMPORTANT* - The approach and code here need review by someone more
knowledgeable than me.

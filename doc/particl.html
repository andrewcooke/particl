<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    Particl can be used to display a graphical hash of a file's contents.
    This <em>complements</em> textual hashes. The two hashes - text and
    image - have very different properties.
</p><p>
    A text hash - a hex value - is a quantitative (exact) representation
    of the hash value.  It allows all the theoretical advantages of the
    hash algorithm to be exploited, but can be viewed by non-expert
    users as complicated, technical, uninteresting and impersonal.  Even
    technical users do not, typically, have an emotional response to a
    string of hex digits.
</p><p>
    A graphical hash - at least as generated here - does not function in
    the same way.  It is a qualitative representation that engages the
    user and provides a "holistic impression".  It can be viewed as
    attractive, interesting and personal.
</p><p>
    So a graphical hash is more likely to engage a user.  But this comes
    at a cost: it does not have the same guaranteed properties as an
    exact, textual value.
</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>
    Automating "attractive, interesting and personal" is hard.
</p><p>
    The solution must adapt to various uses, with different scales and
    contexts.  A system that generates different facial expressions
    would be much more likely to "connect" with the user, but is hard to
    scale (both in size and amount of information represented) and much
    more "intrusive" when embedded within a host site.  In contrast, a
    stylized, "abstract" approach can support parameterisation (size,
    complexity) and can be treated as a "symbol" within a web page.
</p><p>
    But "random" abstract designs look "noisy".  They are hard to describe
    and hard to remember - which makes them hard to compare.  I identified
    three techniques to help solve this problem:<dl>
    <dt>Symmetry</dt>
    <dd>A symmetric design is much less confusing; the axis gives the
    pattern a sense of coherence.  I suspect (like much in design)
    this is related to very low-level pattern-detection that is
    "hard-wired" into our brains.</dd>
    <dt>Range of Scales</dt>
    <dd>The design must contain structure of different sizes.  This allows
    a user to progress from "at a glance" judgements to moe detailed
    inspection.  It also makes the design feel more "natural".</dd>
    <dt>Reduced Palette</dt>
    <dd>Using many colours increases the information density within the
    design, but reduces the overall coherence.</dd>
    </dl>
</p><p>
    Given the above it is no surprise that Particl generates abstract,
    symmetrical patterns, using a range of scales and a limited palette,
    or that it provides parameters (size, complexity, borders) that allow
    adaption within a single aesthetic approach.
</p><p>
    However, initial trials exposed a further issue. I had overlooked
    a large set of potential users: those that are colourblind.
</p>

<h3>Uniqueness</h3>

<p>
    The "hash" style generates a 16x16 mosaic.  Each tile in the mosaic is
    described by three bytes (red, green and blue intensities), but the
    design is symmetric along a diagonal axis.  So the maximum number of
    bytes that can be encoded is 350 bytes.  This is less than
</p>

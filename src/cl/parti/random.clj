; we need a random number generator that can be seeded by a large
; number of bits, is sensitive to even small changes in the seed,
; and is robust to lack of bites in the initial seed (eg if all
; zeroes).  obvious solution is a block cipher in counter mode,
; but they only seem to go to 128 bit keys in standard java, so
; use several in parallel and xor the output.  block size is 128
; bits (16 bytes).  final result is a sequence of bytes.

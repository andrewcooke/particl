  of the padding at either end of the sequence."

  when no background is required."

(defn expand-mosaic
  "The mosaic is generated using a single value / pixel per tile.  This is
  all that is necessary during generation, since each tile is uniform.
  However, during rendering, each tile must be expanded, and the background
  grid (or 'grout') introduced.

  This is achieved here by `repeat`ing tile pixels and then `interpose`ing
  the background."

  `cl.parti.png` module.  Two functions are used - one converts each
  pixel; the other is passed the mosaic dimension and the converted values."

  and then using a sigmoid to map into (-1 1)."

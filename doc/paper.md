Achitecture
-----------

- Isolates aesthetics from maths

Image Algorithm
---------------

Hash Algorithm
--------------

Hash Size
---------

- Ballpark estimates

- Estimate from collisions

  * Hard.

    - Only small mosaics.

    - Locality sensitive hashing.

  * How to scale?

    - Compare fluctuations in large and small mosaics

- Extending (holes)

- What is a good value anyway?

  * Cost of finding matches higher than simple hashes

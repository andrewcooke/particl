Functions to help explore the statistical properties of the generated mosaics.

Analysis here focuses on the internal representation, after normalisation.
This contains the essential 'pattern' in the data, without additional
(and quantifiable) variations due to orientation, choice of hue, etc,
which reduces the search space needed to identify collisions.
